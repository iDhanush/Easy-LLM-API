# Easy LLM API

## Overview
Easy LLM API is a simple and efficient way to deploy open-source language models as an API using [LLMWare](https://pypi.org/project/llmware/). It provides an easy-to-use framework to load, process, and serve models with minimal configuration.

## Features
- Load and serve open-source LLMs easily
- API-based interaction with the models
- Supports text generation, summarization, and question-answering
- Lightweight and customizable deployment

## Customization
- **Model Selection:** Modify `ModelCatalog().load_model("your-model-name")` to use different models.
- **Advanced Configurations:** Use `LLMWare`'s configurations for fine-tuning parameters.
- **Scaling:** Deploy with Docker or integrate with cloud platforms for scalability.
